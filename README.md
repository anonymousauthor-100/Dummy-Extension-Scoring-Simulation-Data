# Dummy-Extension-Scoring-Simulation-Data
A repository with the data from the simulations described in \<redacted\> (2023)

The All_Data.csv file is a matrix with a row for every single batch in the simulation. The columns are the parameters of the simulation.

The model_coefficients.csv file is a matrix with rows for each set of simulation conditions. The columns are the various scoring methods. The cell values are the random slope coefficients.
